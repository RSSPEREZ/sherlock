#Sherlock QA

Sherlock QA is a attempt to simplify the life of testers, product owners and
people that do regression tests.

You should automate most your regressions tests, but sometimes you don't have the
means, time or you need to mix hardware tasks and ask for non technical people to test
you project.

To run localy you will need to have the last version of docker Comunity Edition and and docker-compose.
Please, visit this page to know how to install in your system: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/


    docker-compose build


    docker-compose up -d


Don't delete de volumes created by the docker, since the data is store there.

And remember, a __pr__ is always welcome ;)

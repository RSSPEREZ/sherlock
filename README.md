#Sherlock QA

Sherlock QA is a attempt to simplify the live of testers, product owners and
people that do regressions tests.

You should automate most your regressions tests, but sometimes you don't have the
means, time or you need to mix hardware and ask for people outside technology to test
you project.

### *** This is a alpha version of sherlock qa, dont use in production ***

# Setting  your environment

You will need:
> python 3.5++ -> http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/

> virtualenv (virtualenvwrapper* optional) -> http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

After creating your virtual enviroment, please install all the requirements

> pip install -r requirements.txt

For testing purpose, this is all you need!


# Running Sherlock

Before running the server, you should run the setup file (on the project root):

> python setup.py

after that you can run:

> python run_server.py

For now, the first user and pass is hardcoded (srry for that!) admin:admin
